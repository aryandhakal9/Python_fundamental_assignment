Python Fundamentals Project Overview
This capstone project, derived from a Python Programming crash course, emphasizes essential foundational elements of Python through a series of engaging tasks. The project is structured as follows:
Task One: Understanding Data Types
This task showcases a solid grasp of Python's diverse data types and their applications. Participants will demonstrate how to effectively utilize different types to solve problems.
Task Two: Control Flow with Loops and Conditionals
In this section, the focus is on the functionality of loops and conditional statements. A while loop, along with if-else constructs, will be employed to illustrate the flow of control within the program.
Task Three: Interactive Calculator
This task involves creating a simple calculator that allows users to input two numbers and select an operation to perform. It serves as a practical demonstration of interactive user input and fundamental arithmetic operations.
Task Four: TO-DO List Application
The final task involves developing a basic TO-DO list application where users can add, delete, and view tasks. This project incorporates crucial concepts such as loops, conditional logic, functions, and file handling, providing a thorough exercise in Python programming.
By completing these tasks, participants will reinforce their understanding of Python fundamentals while building practical applications.
